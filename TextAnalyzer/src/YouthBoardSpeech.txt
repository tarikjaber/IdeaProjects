When I first applied for the youth board, I unintentionally applied for every single position. I tried at the treasurer and president position, but, unfortunately, I didnt win. Today, I come to present myself once again and give you reasons of why you should pick me for a position on the board. First, leadership. Ive had many experiences in leadership positions in my past.
One of them is TIPS, or teens inventing peaceful solutions. It is a club at William Mason High School that me and a couple other of my friends created. The group aims to achieve common ground on controversial issues such as Universal basic income or the Iran conflict. We give teenagers a venue to give their opinions on these topics without the pressure of political correctness. I create topics for participants to discuss and oversee the discussion before all hell breaks loose. 
Next, I was the logistics coordinator at a hackathon called CincyHacks. A hackathon is an event where people interested in computer science can get together to compete and participate in workshops. I was delegated with working for sponsorships, coordinating with mentors from amazon, running the workshops, and creating a detailed schedule. The event was a success with eighty participants. 
Finally, I was the marketing director of the Youth Conference.I created enticing reasons for the youth to come to the event, from bingo boards to raffles and kahoots. I helped to market the event at the masjid. I have already had leadership experience in the mosque, which would seamlessly translate to effective leadership in the youth board.Through these three leadership experiences, I learnt what works, and what doesnt. Obviously, I am not perfect but these experiences have given me some insight into what being an effective leader looks like.
Furthermore, my merit. I am a student at William Mason High School with a weighted GPA of four point seven two and an SAT score of fifteen hundred. I don’t say these numbers to brag, but to give my qualifications. They indicate my level of work ethic, which is an essential skill in any leadership role. I have qualified for the AIME in the past, a prestigious math exam where the top two point five percent scorers in the AMC ten and top five percent scorers in the AMC twelve qualify. And keep in mind, most people taking the AMC (the american mathematics examination) in the first place are avid math lovers. I took AP Calculus BC my sophomore year and received As both semesters and eventually got a five on the AP test. I am very passionate in math and this would allow me to be successful as a treasurer. 
Another unique skill I have is computer programming. I have experience in a vast array of programming languages ranging from Python to Java to HTML and CSS. I created an app on the iOS platform called Drop da Ball. I’ve experimented with neural networks via tensorflow and python. I could create websites and apps for youth board events or ICGC events in general. With my thorough experience in computer science, I could and would love to serve as an applications or digital master within the board. 
But most importantly, I feel like it will strengthen me as a Muslim. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how popular you are, what college you go to, or how much money you have if your relationship with Allah (SWT) is weak. By actively participating as a leader at ICGC, I believe that it will get me closer to the community, which in turn will render me a better Muslim. Because that, truly, is what matters most.
Through my leadership, merit, and past experience, I would be a successful member of the ICGC youth board. I appreciate all of you taking time out of your day to listen to my speech. I hope you consider me in the election process and have a good day. Maasalam.
